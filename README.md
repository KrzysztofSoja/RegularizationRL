# RegularizationRL

The repository contains code implementing selected regularization methods for reinforcement learning algorithms.

The implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms was taken from the Stable Baselines 3 library (https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).

The result of the experiments is available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CWULe0hXVAze7DuSQtmM4QK1GjN4F6dG?usp=sharing
